# Reference Project Description

For each prompt or task:

1. **First read** `Project Description.md` (project root) to understand:
   - What we're building (product overview, problem, solution)
   - Key features and priorities
   - Technical constraints and stack

2. Use that context to inform your answers, code changes, and suggestions so they stay aligned with the project goals.

3. If the user's request seems to conflict with or extend the PRD, call it out and suggest how to proceed.
